This repository contains a few scripts (jupyter notebooks), which produce RGB images from HST, JWST and mixed-telescope observations.

We choose the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 4321 as our test example to produce a suite of RGB images across the electromagnetic spectrum from optical over infrared to radio wavelengths.

### 1. HST RGB image

* red = `F814W`
* green = `F555W`
* blue = `F438W`

### 2. JWST RGB image


### 3. MUSE-JWST-ALMA composite image
